### **Experiment [Number]: [Experiment Title]**

**1. Research Question**

*   *Clearly define the core question this experiment aims to investigate.*
*   *For example: Can this experiment improve the prediction accuracy of [specific event] through [specific features]? Or, does [certain model] perform better than the baseline model?*

**2. Methodology**

*   **Model:**
    *   *Describe the model or algorithm you will use.*
    *   *For example: Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), etc.* 

*   **Features:**
    *   *Explain which features you will use for training.*
    *   *For example: Raw EEG data, spectral features (e.g., Fourier Transform), wavelet transform features, or specific channel combinations filtered from previous experiments.*

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  *List the specific execution steps of the experiment.*
    2.  *For example: Data preprocessing flow, model training details, cross-validation strategy, etc.*
    3.  *Define the main metrics you will use to evaluate model performance (e.g., AUC, Accuracy, F1-score).*

**3. Key Findings & Analysis**

*   *Summarize the main results and observations from the experiment.*
*   *It is recommended to use data or charts to support your findings (e.g., average AUC scores, changes in specific channel performance, etc.).*
*   *Analyze the possible reasons behind these results and compare them with past experimental results.*

**4. Conclusion & Next Steps**

*   *Summarize the main conclusions of this experiment and directly answer the research question posed in the first section.*
*   *Based on the findings of this experiment, propose concrete next steps or the design direction for the next experiment (`Experiment [Next Number]`).*
*   *For example: The next step will be to try more complex models, or to apply the best performing feature combination to all subjects.*
