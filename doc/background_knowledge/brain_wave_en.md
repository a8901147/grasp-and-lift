# Brain Waves Basics

Brain waves are electrical signals produced by the activity of neurons, which can be measured using an Electroencephalogram (EEG). Different brain wave frequencies are closely associated with different states of the brain, such as sleep, relaxation, and focus.

## Main Brain Wave Types and Their Characteristics

| Band | Frequency (Hz) | Key Associated States and Functions | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Delta (δ)** | 0.5 – 4 Hz | Deep sleep, infant sleep, certain brain disorders | **Lowest frequency**. Typically represents an unconscious or deep resting state. |
| **Theta (θ)** | 4 – 8 Hz | Light sleep, deep relaxation, meditation, memory, and navigation | **Slow wave**. Associated with attention, working memory, and emotional processing. |
| **Alpha (α)** | 8 – 13 Hz | Awake, relaxed, eyes-closed state | **Intermediate wave**. Often represents a non-focused, resting state of the brain. In motor cortex areas, waves in this band are also known as **Mu (μ) waves** and are directly related to motor intention. |
| **Beta (β)** | 13 – 30 Hz | Awake, active thinking, concentration, anxiety | **Fast wave**. Highly correlated with motor execution, logical thinking, and active cognitive engagement. |
| **Gamma (γ)** | > 30 Hz | High-intensity cognitive processing, cross-regional information integration | **Fastest wave**. Associated with complex perceptual tasks and higher-order cognitive functions. |
